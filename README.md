# Memory Leak Examples

This is a simple training application to help you get comfortable finding memory leaks and fixing them in the context of an actual web application. While this application is an [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) app, there is little in this training that is specific to Ember and pre-requisite knowledge of Ember is not required in order to do any of the exercises provided.
